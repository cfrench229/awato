#AWATO

My project for Awato. I know of one bug with display, but I haven't ran into functionality errors. I don't do a lot of
input checking, due to the fact that I am relying on the user using the form correctly. I am still learning so angularjs/html/javascript/css may not be the best indentation/practice. 

Thank you and I hope you enjoy it!
